# -node.js-websockets-chat

I wrote a simple chat to get better understanding of websockets (using sockets.io).
This web app also uses other Node.js tool - Express, JS ECMA6, and of course some basic CSS and HTML.

Here's the screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/m372BUv.jpg

How to run locally:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed
2. Run "npm install" in a console in a directory with this github project
3. Run "node index.js" in a console
4. Open a browser and visit "localhost:4000"
5. Open another tab or window with "localhost:4000" and chat with yourself!
